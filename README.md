# Animated Cat Loader

This is a simple HTML and CSS code snippet that creates an animated cat loader. The loader features a playful animation of a cat formed by various segments. Each segment is given a distinct gradient effect, resulting in a visually appealing and engaging loader animation.

## Getting Started

To use this animated cat loader in your project, follow these steps:

1. Copy the HTML code and paste it into your HTML file within the `<body>` tag.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
    <title>Animated Cat Loader</title>
</head>

<body>
    <div class="cat">
        <!-- Cat segments are added here -->
    </div>
</body>

</html>
```

2. Copy the CSS code and paste it into a file named `style.css` in the same directory as your HTML file.

```css
/* Paste the provided CSS code here */
```

3. Make sure to place both the HTML and CSS files in the same directory.

## Customization

You can customize the loader to match your project's design by adjusting the colors, sizes, and animation timings in the CSS code. Here are a few things you can customize:

- Background color: Modify the `background` property of the `.cat` class to change the background color of the loader.
- Gradient colors: Update the gradient colors used in the `.cat__segment:before` pseudo-element to create your desired color scheme.
- Animation duration: Adjust the animation duration and easing in the `@keyframes loop` to control the speed and smoothness of the loader animation.

## Compatibility

This code is written using HTML and CSS and should be compatible with most modern web browsers. It utilizes CSS animations for the loader effect, so ensure that your target browsers support CSS animations.
